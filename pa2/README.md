# Project Assignment 2
This project is primarily meant to build out our ML pipelines, which is where the majority of work went. 
We then used this pipeline to develop logistic classification models through Sci-Kit Learn on a Kaggle 
dataset. You'll notice that the accuracy stinks and that the dataset isn't great. That wasn't the point: 
we're still getting into the meat of things. 

## What's here: 
1. Classifier.py: a wrapper class for data classification methods
2. pipeline.py: the beginnings of my ML pipeline
3. run_pa2.py: most of the code used in the write-up
4. GOLAB_PA2_writeup.pdf: the write-up for the Kaggle problem
